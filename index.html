        <p>That was the intro song of CSI. But the real question is who am I? My name is Emre. Or as my tumblr account says: AngryTiran. I am 15 years old.</p>
        <p>Down here there are some links to my other socials after that I am going to tell what about myself.</p>

        <p>I live in the Netherlands. And I love digital stuff if this is building my own application, editing audio or video, or just listening to music. Last summer I got an email from GitHub Education. If you are currently enrolled in a university or high school, I would really recommend getting GitHub Education. It is totally free and you get a lot of perks like GitHub Pro, GitHub Copilot, a 1-year subscription to 1Password, and a lot more. If you are a developer (enrolled in school), I would really recommend signing up. About a hack club and ARCADE. I won a lot of neat prizes and learned a lot during this period.</p>
        <p>I am currently in school, 4vwo, which is the 4th year of high school in the Netherlands. I am currently in the profile N&T, which is short for Nature and Technology. I want to do something technical later in life like Engineering, Computer Science, or something like that. I already can write code in HTML, CSS, JS, and C#. I recently learned with Hackclub's Hackpad how to build a PCB with a microcontroller and how to program firmware for a Macropad.</p>
        <p>To sum everything up, I want to learn because I find learning fun. Loved my site and want to tell me something? Send a mail to: me-site@kluizenaren.com</p>
